# :cloud: next-serverless

Ideas/Todos:

* Cli to deploy, remove, show logs etc
* make sure to pass -p & -H args to custom server
* only set assetPrefix when the user didn't set it
* server out of the box
* automatically add request prefix (e.g. /prod/_next instead of /_next)
* provide link component which overrides `as` with the request prefix (e.g. /prod/about instead of /about)
* make router overwritable (e.g. for next-routes)
